      "abstract": "Digital signal processing in biomedical applications requires advanced filtering techniques that can simultaneously optimize multiple performance criteria. This study introduces a novel multi-objective metaheuristic approach for Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design, addressing the complex challenges of signal processing optimization. The research employs advanced metaheuristic algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Black Widow Optimization (BWO), Chaos Game Optimization (CGO), Harmony Search (HS), Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), and Atomic Orbital Search (AOS) to optimize multiple filter design parameters jointly. In contrast to conventional approaches, the proposed multi-objective optimization strategy demonstrates superior performance in signal filtering. The proposed method considers the important design trade-offs at the same time, such as minimizing signal power after stopband frequency, reducing stopband ripple, maximizing stopband first lobe and stopband edge frequency attenuation, and reducing computational complexity. The method is employed on ElectroCardioGram (ECG) signals from the MIT-BIH open-access database. Performance comparison indicated that multi-objective metaheuristic filters achieved much better performance than conventional FIR filters. The optimized filters exhibited improved stopband attenuation, narrower transition bands, lower power leakage, and more efficient signal processing at a cut-off frequency of 100 Hz. Signal power measurements demonstrated significant improvements. While conventional FIR filters …",

      "abstract": "This study proposes a novel method that uses electroencephalography (EEG) signals to classify Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and demographically matched healthy control groups. The method utilizes the reduced beta activity and amplitude decrease in EEG signals that are associated with PD. The study involved 61 PD patients and 61 demographically matched controls groups, and EEG signals were recorded in various conditions (eyes closed, eyes open, eyes both open and closed, on-drug, off-drug) from three publicly available EEG data sources (New Mexico, Iowa, and Turku). The preprocessed EEG signals were classified using features obtained from gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features through the Hankelization of EEG signals. The performance of classifiers with these novel features was evaluated using extensive cross-validations (CV) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) schemes. This method under 10 × 10 fold CV, the method was able to differentiate PD groups from healthy control groups using a support vector machine (SVM) with an accuracy of 92.4 ± 0.01, 85.7 ± 0.02, and 77.1 ± 0.06 for New Mexico, Iowa, and Turku datasets, respectively. After a head-to-head comparison with state-of-the-art methods, this study showed an increase in the classification of PD and controls.",

      "abstract": "The design approach presented in this paper uses a new metaheuristic method Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) to design a 2-channel quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks. For this study, finite impulse response (FIR) low-pass prototype filter coefficients are optimized to minimize the cost function. The cost function is formulated as the sum of four terms: the square sum of the errors between this estimated frequency response and the ideal filter response, passband ripple, stopband ripple, and stopband edge frequency error. These parameters are important components of FIR filter prototype design that are often used alone in many studies. To obtain a QMF bank prototype filter, prototype filter modulated with an appropriate complex exponential signal. The produced design results of the proposed method like performance parameters, frequency responses of prototype filters and QMF bank results are presented and compared with earlier reported results. The results show that the presented study has significant improvement in the performance parameters of QMF banks and prototype filter.",

      "abstract": "There are two types of digital filters designed and used on digital signal processing systems: finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR). There are two approaches used during the design of FIR filters. The first of these is classical methods, while the other is optimization-based methods. The use of metaheuristic algorithms in optimization-based methods has been increasing in recent years, especially in order to realize more performance filter designs. In order to design a filter as close to the ideal as possible, in this study, FIR filter designs were carried out with metaheuristic algorithms using the multi-objective error approach, and the performance parameters of these designed filters were analyzed. FIR filter coefficients were optimized using Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm, Black Widow Algorithm, Squirrel Search Algorithm, and Harmony Search Algorithm. When the obtained results and literature studies were compared, it was seen that there were significant improvements in the performance parameters of the FIR filter obtained with the proposed approach.",
